{"name":"FlexGP","tagline":"Tutorial and Blog","body":"# FlexGP: Flexible Machine Learning with Genetic Programming\r\nFlexGP is a Genetic Programming framework aimed at data modeling and knowledge discovery. Current release provides functionality both for performing Symbolic Regression on numerical datasets and for testing the retrieved models. In this website we provide a quick tutorial on how to get started with FlexGP.\r\n\r\n# Current release\r\n\r\nThe functionality of the current release is limited to Symbolic Regression tasks in a single desktop (capability to attack binary classification problems and extensions to support cloud-based executions will be added soon).\r\n\r\n# Tutorial\r\n\r\nWe provide a tutorial for the different core learners developed within the frame of the FlexGP project. Additionally, we provide a guide to get started with FlexGP and deploy your runs in cloud environments.\r\n\r\n## Running the desktop version of the core learners\r\n1. [SR learner: Symbolic Regression](srlearner.html)\r\n2. Rule tree classification\r\n3. Rule list classification\r\n4. GP function classification\r\n\r\n## Cloud-based executions with FlexGP\r\n1. FlexGP + SR learner\r\n2. FlexGP + Rule list classification\r\n3. FlexGP + Rule tree classification\r\n4. FlexGP + GP function classification\r\n\r\n# Examples\r\nTo check reports visit our blog:\r\n[FlexGP Blog](blog.html)\r\n\r\n# Support or Contact\r\nThis page has been created by the Any-scale Learning For All (ALFA) group at MIT.

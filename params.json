Current release provides functionality both for modeling data and for testing the retrieved models. In this website we provide a quick tutorial to get started and model your data.\r\n\r\n# Tutorial\r\n\r\n## Step 1: Downloading the source code\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Step 2: Running FlexGP \r\nIt is possible to run FlexGP directly from your terminal or from Matlab\r\n\r\n### Running FlexGP from the terminal\r\n\r\n### Running FlexGP from Matlab\r\n\r\n## Step 3: Speeding up your runs with C++ optimized execution\r\nThis option is only supported for Linux Debian platforms and requires the gcc and g++ compilers:\r\n```\r\n$ sudo apt-get install gcc\r\n$ sudo apt-get install g++\r\n```\r\nModify the Linux kernel parameter governing the shared memory size to be at least as large as the data being analyzed, in the nex example we set it to 2GB\r\n```\r\n$ echo 2147483648 > /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sudo nano /sys/kernel/shmmax \r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Support or Contact\r\nThis page has been created by the Any-scale Learning For All (ALFA) group at MIT.

{"name":"FlexGP","tagline":"Tutorial and Blog","body":"# FlexGP: Flexible Machine Learning with Genetic Programming\r\nFlexGP is a long-term project aimed at data modeling and knowledge discovery with evolutionary computation. Within the scope of FlexGP, we have developed a number of evolutionary learners and two cloud platforms for large-scale machine learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n# FlexGP learners\r\n\r\nWe provide an overview and tutorial of the different core learners developed within the frame of the FlexGP project. \r\n\r\n# Cloud-based platforms\r\n\r\n## FlexGP: a cloud platform for large scale regression problems\r\n\r\n## FCUBE: a cloud platform for large scale classification problems\r\n\r\n# Publications\r\n\r\n# Support or Contact\r\nThis page has been created by the Any-scale Learning For All (ALFA) group at MIT.
